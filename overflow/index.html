            Frontend CSS is a crucial part of web development 
            that handles the visual presentation of a website. 
            It uses Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) to style HTML elements, 
            controlling aspects like colors, fonts, layout, and responsiveness. 
            Essentially, CSS transforms the basic structure of a webpage 
            (created with HTML) into an engaging and user-friendly interface. 
            Without CSS, websites would appear as simple, unformatted text, 
            making it difficult to navigate and visually unappealing. By using CSS, 
            developers can ensure websites are not only visually attractive 
            but also consistent across different browsers and devices.

            The Cascading Style Sheet language allows you to adjust 
            the way in which the HTML elements are rendered, improving 
            the visuals of your webpage. JavaScript: This is the de facto 
            programming language for frontend development, and it allows 
            you to add dynamism to your websites/web apps.
